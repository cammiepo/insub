Put the perl script in your irssi scripts directory, or in
~/.irssi/scripts.

In irssi, type /run <scriptname>

Or from the commandline, just run insub.pl. It'll output in ANSI but you can
add -mirc or -html, and so on, to coerce the output.

Some of the filters rely on third-party tools being installed, such as figlet.
So you should install that if you want to figletize.

Be nice.

== COWSAY SUPPORT ==
If you want cowsay support, install cowsay and optionally throw all the
cowfiles included here into  your global cowfile directory for even more
offensive ascii technology.
====================

USAGE:

some examples:

./insub.pl -1 -figlet -cow hi
